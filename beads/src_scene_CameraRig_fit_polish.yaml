description: Refine CameraRig fit so it uses dataset bounds/exaggeration consistently, with safe defaults and reset integration.
acceptance_criteria: |
  - CameraRig fit uses computed bounds/bounding sphere with exaggeration and avoids overshooting on flat trajectories.
  - Reset/fit controls continue to work; typecheck/build pass.
files_touched:
  - src/scene/CameraRig.tsx
  - src/scene/GlobeCanvas.tsx (if needed)
